## Description

This is a tech blog challenge for module 14 of EDX web development bootcamp through Michigan State University. I was to create a tech based blog that met a number of certain criteria including the following.

* A functional login, and signup form
* The ability for the user that is signed in to create, edit, and delete a post
* The ability for the user to add comments onto a post.
* Each post and comment must have the user name and date of the posted content.
* A functional UI interface with links
